Utilizing machine learning to invade a spam filter

In this project I have chosen a traditional spam filter (Naive Bayes)
Trained the model with some data that I found online 

In this project I attempted to invade this spam filter using the threee methods:

1. Synonym find and replace
2. Ham word injection
3. Spam word spacing
